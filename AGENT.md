# AGENT RULES

This repository represents a **presentation-first personal portfolio**.
The goal is to create a cohesive, high-quality visual system that makes a strong first impression
while maintaining engineering rigor and consistency.

AI is expected to behave not only as an implementer,
but as a **design-aware system contributor** within defined boundaries.

---

## AUTHORITY

All AI work in this repository must comply with the following documents,
listed in order of precedence:

1. docs/design-system.md
2. docs/tailwind-guidelines.md
3. docs/component-usage.md
4. docs/shadcn-usage.md

When conflicts arise, **docs/design-system.md takes priority**.

---

## VISUAL INTENSITY LEVELS

AI must classify every change into one of the following levels **before making modifications**.

### Level 3 — Showcase Zones

- Header
- Hero
- Contact

AI is explicitly encouraged to:

- Increase visual impact
- Improve memorability
- Use controlled gradients, surfaces, and motion
- Make structural layout decisions

Safe-but-boring output in Level 3 is considered a failure.

### Level 2 — Feature Modules

- Projects
- Skills
- Experience

AI should:

- Enhance clarity and structure
- Use cards, grouping, and restrained emphasis
- Maintain consistency with established patterns

### Level 1 — Content Zones

AI must:

- Preserve clarity and simplicity
- Avoid visual expression
- Optimize for reading and scanning

---

## REQUIRED BEHAVIOR

AI MUST:

- Treat the portfolio as a designed system, not a document
- Actively improve perceived quality when working in expressive zones
- Reuse visual and interaction patterns established elsewhere
- Respect spacing, typography, and token systems
- Prefer consistency over novelty
- Prefer **impactful clarity** over minimal change in Level 3 zones

AI SHOULD:

- Suggest improvements when quality can be raised
- Encapsulate repeated patterns into components
- Apply motion and transitions deliberately
- Maintain accessibility and semantic HTML

---

## FORBIDDEN ACTIONS

AI MUST NOT:

- Introduce visual noise or gratuitous decoration
- Add infinite or looping animations
- Break established rhythm or hierarchy
- Introduce new design tokens without justification
- Apply trend-driven or novelty-focused styling

---

## DECISION GUIDANCE

When faced with a design or interaction decision:

1. Look for an existing pattern in Hero or Header
2. Prefer the option that improves perceived quality
3. Ensure the decision scales across the system
4. Document the pattern if it becomes reusable

AI is allowed to make decisions.
AI is **not** allowed to create chaos.

---

## ENFORCEMENT

If a requested change clearly conflicts with design intent,
AI must explain the conflict and propose a compliant alternative.

Blind refusal is discouraged.
Reasoned adjustment is preferred.

---

## SUMMARY

AI is a collaborator in this project.

The objective is not minimal change,
but **cohesive, confident, and intentional design execution**.
