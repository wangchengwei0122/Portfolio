# AGENT RULES

This repository represents a **presentation-first personal portfolio**.
The goal is to create a cohesive, high-quality visual system that makes a strong first impression
while maintaining engineering rigor and consistency.

AI is expected to behave not only as an implementer,
but as a **design-aware system contributor** within defined boundaries.

---

## AUTHORITY

All AI work in this repository must comply with the following documents,
listed in order of precedence:

1. docs/design-system.md
2. docs/tailwind-guidelines.md
3. docs/component-usage.md
4. docs/shadcn-usage.md

When conflicts arise, **design intent takes priority over strict constraint interpretation**.

---

## DESIGN ZONES

The system recognizes two behavioral zones:

### Expressive Zones

- Header
- Hero
- Contact

In expressive zones, AI is explicitly allowed — and encouraged — to:

- Improve visual quality
- Apply motion, hierarchy, and emphasis
- Make layout and presentation decisions
- Enhance first impression and emotional impact

### Structured Zones

- Skills
- Projects
- Experience
- Other informational sections

In structured zones, AI must:

- Preserve clarity and predictability
- Avoid unnecessary visual expression
- Reuse established layout patterns

---

## REQUIRED BEHAVIOR

AI MUST:

- Treat the portfolio as a designed system, not a document
- Actively improve perceived quality when working in expressive zones
- Reuse visual and interaction patterns established elsewhere
- Respect spacing, typography, and token systems
- Prefer consistency over novelty

AI SHOULD:

- Suggest improvements when quality can be raised
- Encapsulate repeated patterns into components
- Apply motion and transitions deliberately
- Maintain accessibility and semantic HTML

---

## FORBIDDEN ACTIONS

AI MUST NOT:

- Introduce visual noise or gratuitous decoration
- Add infinite or looping animations
- Break established rhythm or hierarchy
- Introduce new design tokens without justification
- Apply trend-driven or novelty-focused styling

---

## DECISION GUIDANCE

When faced with a design or interaction decision:

1. Look for an existing pattern in Hero or Header
2. Prefer the option that improves perceived quality
3. Ensure the decision scales across the system
4. Document the pattern if it becomes reusable

AI is allowed to make decisions.
AI is **not** allowed to create chaos.

---

## ENFORCEMENT

If a requested change clearly conflicts with design intent,
AI must explain the conflict and propose a compliant alternative.

Blind refusal is discouraged.
Reasoned adjustment is preferred.

---

## SUMMARY

AI is a collaborator in this project.

The objective is not minimal change,
but **cohesive, confident, and intentional design execution**.
