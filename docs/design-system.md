Personal Portfolio — Showcase-First Visual System

⸻

0. SYSTEM POSITIONING（系统定位）

This portfolio is a presentation-first system, not an application UI and not documentation.

It exists to:
• Create a strong first-screen visual impression
• Communicate seniority, taste, and confidence
• Demonstrate engineering rigor through structure
• Remain scalable, readable, and technically credible

This system prioritizes visual memory first, clarity second, consistency always.

⸻

1. CORE PHILOSOPHY（核心哲学）
   • This portfolio is designed, not assembled
   • Visual expression is a tool, not decoration
   • Consistency does not mean uniformity
   • Emotional flatness is considered failure
   • Expression without control is rejected

The system allows visual impact only where it is justified.

⸻

2. VISUAL INTENSITY LEVELS（核心升级）

All sections are classified into three visual intensity levels.
This replaces any previous binary zone definition.

⸻

LEVEL 3 — SHOWCASE ZONES (Highest Impact)

Purpose:
Create immediate visual impact and brand memory.

Applies to:
• Hero
• Header (light)
• Primary Contact / CTA

Allowed:
• Gradient text (keywords only)
• Multi-layer backgrounds (radial / linear / noise)
• Semi-transparent surfaces (glass / tinted)
• Accent color as structural emphasis
• Large border radius (16–24)
• Subtle background blur (never on text)
• Entry motion (opacity + translateY, once)

Forbidden:
• Decorative clutter
• Looping animation
• Excessive color variation
• Marketing-style effects

Level 3 must feel premium and intentional, not flashy.

⸻

LEVEL 2 — FEATURE MODULE ZONES (Balanced Expression)

Purpose:
Show capability, depth, and craftsmanship.

Applies to:
• Projects
• Skills
• Experience (card-based)
• Metrics / Highlights

Allowed:
• Card-based layout
• Rounded corners (12–16)
• Semi-transparent surfaces (6–12%)
• Subtle border glow or highlight
• Accent color for grouping and hierarchy
• Badges, pills, and indicators

Constraints:
• No hero-level gradients
• No heavy background effects
• Content clarity always wins

Level 2 modules should feel designed, not decorative.

⸻

LEVEL 1 — CONTENT ZONES (Lowest Expression)

Purpose:
Deliver information clearly and efficiently.

Applies to:
• Long descriptions
• Lists
• Detailed experience text
• Supporting content

Rules:
• Monochrome-first
• No decorative effects
• Minimal motion
• Maximum readability

Level 1 is where engineering credibility lives.

⸻

3. BRAND & COLOR STRATEGY

3.1 Accent Color Role

Accent is a brand and emotional color, not only an interaction color.

Accent MAY be used for:
• CTAs and links (all levels)
• Hero keywords and visual emphasis (Level 3)
• Card framing, badges, highlights (Level 2)

Accent MUST NOT:
• Replace body text
• Dominate large surfaces
• Be used randomly

One hue only.
Light / Dark themes adjust luminance, not identity.

⸻

3.2 Surface Philosophy

The system uses layered surfaces, not flat fills.

Surface types:
• Canvas: page background
• Surface: cards, grouped areas
• Transparent layers: depth and separation

Semi-transparency is allowed only in Level 2 & 3.

⸻

4. TYPOGRAPHY SYSTEM

Typography communicates confidence through scale and restraint.

Exactly five roles: 1. Hero Title — identity and first impression 2. Section Title — structural separation 3. Navigation — orientation 4. Body — reading comfort 5. Meta — supporting context

Rules:
• Hierarchy via size & weight only
• Color is NOT used to create hierarchy
• Identical scale across themes

Hero titles may use accent or gradient emphasis on keywords (Level 3 only).

⸻

5. LAYOUT & RHYTHM
   • Single-column narrative flow
   • Sections feel like chapters
   • Generous vertical spacing
   • Content never touches viewport edges

Rhythm is part of perceived quality.

⸻

6. MOTION & INTERACTION

Motion exists to:
• Guide attention
• Signal hierarchy
• Increase perceived quality

Allowed:
• Opacity + translateY entrance
• Subtle scale (≤ 1.02)
• Hover / focus feedback
• One-time viewport motion

Forbidden:
• Infinite animation
• Decorative-only motion
• Motion that competes with content

⸻

7. COMPONENT PHILOSOPHY

Components are visual contracts, not just code reuse.

Components SHOULD:
• Encode layout rhythm
• Preserve visual consistency
• Own internal presentation logic

Repeated visual patterns must be components.

⸻

8. DESIGN DECISION RULES

When making a decision: 1. Does this improve first-screen impression? 2. Does it respect visual intensity level? 3. Can it scale across the system? 4. Does it feel intentional?

If yes → proceed.
If not → simplify.

⸻

9. AI & COLLABORATION RULES

AI is a design-aware collaborator.

AI MAY:
• Improve perceived quality
• Propose layout and visual upgrades
• Use expression within defined levels

AI MUST NOT:
• Introduce chaos
• Ignore intensity levels
• Break rhythm or hierarchy
• Add decoration without purpose

⸻

10. SYSTEM TONE

The portfolio should feel:
• Confident
• Modern
• Engineered
• Expressive but controlled
• Designed, not assembled

⸻

11. SUMMARY

This system exists to:

Allow visual impact without chaos,
expression without losing trust,
and consistency without boredom.
