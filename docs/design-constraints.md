# DESIGN CONSTRAINTS
**Personal Portfolio — Experience‑Driven, Dual Theme Support**

---

## CORE PHILOSOPHY

**This portfolio is a presentation, not a document.**

Its primary job is to create a strong first impression within the first few seconds,
while remaining clear, readable, and technically credible.

Visual expression is not decoration.
It is a communication tool used deliberately to signal taste, confidence, and seniority.

---

## THEME PHILOSOPHY

**Light and dark themes are both first‑class.**

Theme switching adjusts luminance and contrast only.
Structure, hierarchy, layout rhythm, and interaction patterns must remain identical.

A user switching themes should feel continuity, not novelty.

---

## EXPERIENCE ZONES (CRITICAL)

The portfolio is divided into two behavioral zones:

### Expressive Zones
These sections are allowed — and expected — to create emotional impact.

- Header
- Hero
- Contact

Expressive zones MAY:
- Use motion and animation (first‑entry only)
- Establish visual emphasis
- Use background contrast or subtle framing
- Guide attention and action (CTAs)

The first screen must create a visual memory point.
After the hero, the system returns to restraint.

### Structured Zones
These sections prioritize clarity and scannability.

- Skills
- Projects
- Experience
- Any informational sections

Structured zones MUST:
- Remain restrained and content‑first
- Avoid visual noise
- Favor predictability over expression

---

## ACCENT COLOR STRATEGY

**One accent hue. Used intentionally as a brand emphasis system.**

- **Used for:** Links, buttons, navigation state, key CTAs
- **Brand emphasis (Expressive Zones only):** Hero keywords, contact identifiers, CTA emphasis
- **Not used for:** Body text, headings in structured zones, backgrounds, decoration
- **Cross‑theme behavior:** Same hue, adjusted luminance only

Accent color can signal both interaction and brand recognition.
Brand emphasis must stay confined to expressive zones.

---

## TYPOGRAPHY SYSTEM

**Five roles only:**

1. Hero title — identity and first impression
2. Section title — structural separation
3. Navigation text — persistent orientation
4. Body text — reading comfort
5. Meta text — supporting context

Rules:
- Hierarchy via size and weight only
- No color‑based hierarchy
- No intermediate sizes
- Identical scale across themes

---

## SPACING & LAYOUT RHYTHM

- Sections feel like chapters
- White / dark space conveys confidence
- Internal spacing is consistent and predictable
- Section spacing is significantly larger than internal spacing
- No content touches viewport edges

Rhythm is part of the design language.

---

## MOTION & VISUAL EXPRESSION

Motion is allowed — but must be purposeful.

Allowed:
- Opacity + translateY entrance animations
- Subtle scaling (≤ 1.02)
- Motion triggered once on first viewport entry
- Hover and focus feedback

Forbidden:
- Infinite or looping animations
- Decorative motion without meaning
- Visual effects that distract from content

---

## OVERALL TONE

The portfolio should feel:

- Confident
- Modern
- Intentional
- Calm, but not sterile
- Designed, not assembled
